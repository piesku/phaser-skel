        Phaser skel
        ===========

A simple and modern template for bootstrapping Phaser games.


        Available commands
        ------------------

Build and run once:

    npm install
    make build
    make serve

Watch the source and rebuild on changes:

    make watch

Build and minify:

    make dist


        Public files
        ------------

The public/ folder should be copied on a remote server.  The play/ subdir is
where the game is located.  play/index.html uses the minified bundle.
play/debug.html uses the unminified bundle and is suitable for debugging.
